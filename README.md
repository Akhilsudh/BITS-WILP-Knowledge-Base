# BITS-WILP-Knowledge-Base
Welcome to my BITS WILP Knowledge Base. This is a personal note book for all the notes I take as part of my journey here at BITS. To know more about what a knowledge base is check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base) out.

## So what is the purpose of this? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My learning method includes taking a lot of notes through a local note taking tool called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). This website simply hosts that vault of Obsidian notes. The purpose of this page is to make the notes taken throughout my coursework accessible to myself and others in the same boat as me. Maybe this can help you too ü§òüèΩ
To know more about Obsidian and what it is, you can read about it in my blog article [here](https://justanothergeek.hashnode.dev/obsidian-as-a-second-brain)
