## General Orientation
### Grading Procedure
1. Students are graded with relative grading
2. Letter grades Range from A, A-, B, B-, C, C-, D and E where each letter corresponds to grade points 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4 and 2 respectively
3. For project work a non-letter grade is awarded such as EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR and POOR.
4. If a student is absent for any of the written examination, the student will be declared as a RRA (Required to Register Again) for that course.
5. The CGPA awarded in a 10 point scale is calculated as:

	$$
	CGPA = {(U_1G_1 + U_2G_2 + U_3G_3 + U_4G_4)\over(U1 + U2 + U3 + U4)}
  $$

	Where U<sub>1</sub>, U<sub>2</sub>, U<sub>3</sub> and U<sub>4</sub> denote the Units associated with the courses taken G<sub>1</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>, G<sub>3</sub> and G<sub>4</sub> denote the Grade Points awarded in the respective courses.

6. Non Letter Grades DO NOT go into CGPA Computation

### General Examination Schedules and Evaluative Components
1. Two exams are conducted throughout the semester.
	1. A mid semester Test
	2. A Comprehensive Exam
2. Each of these two exams are conducted twice as a regular mode and a make up mode where one can take an examination at a separate date if one was not able to join the regular exam.

### Evaluative Components:

| Evaluative Component | Name                     | Type             | Duration               | Session                     | Weightage |
