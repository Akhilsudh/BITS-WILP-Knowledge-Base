## Part 2
Part 2 of this subject was problem heavy, so notes are captured in the [following pdf](https://github.com/Akhilsudh/BITS-WILP-Knowledge-Base/blob/master/docs/Knowledge%20Base/Assets/PDFs/MathNotes.pdf). Problems are not completely solved since this is only the notes captured during the live lecture itself.
