# MFDS Assignment 1
### Tasks
**Q1)** Write code to implement the Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting for the system $An×nx = b$. Include a statement in the code to indicate the swapping of rows. Using the code 

- draw the $log−log$ plot of $n$ versus the time taken for forward elimination and backward substitution (as separate graphs) by taking values of in-between $1000$ and $10000$ in steps of $1000$. Determine the time  taken for a single computation in your machine (by averaging over $1000$ runs) and compare the time taken with the actual time derived in the class. This should give the time taken for the partial pivoting.  

- solve the system $A5×5x = b$, with random entries and display your results.

**Q2)** Gauss Jordan method To find the inverse of a non-singular matrix $A$ by Gauss Jordan method, one starts with the augmented matrix $[A|I]$ where $I$ is the identity matrix of the same size and performs elementary row operations on $A$ so that $A$ is reduced to $I$. Performing the same elementary operations on $I$ would give $A−1$. Assuming that $Am×m$ is an invertible  matrix, write a code to find the inverse of $A$ using the Gauss Jordan method. Using the code, find the inverse of a $6 x 6$ random matrix which is non-singular.
