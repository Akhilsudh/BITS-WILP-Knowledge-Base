# MFDS Assignment 2
### Tasks
**Q1)** Write a code to minimize $f(x, y) = (x − y)^2 + 1 − x$ using the Gradient descent method. Take a suitable initial value and do the iterations till the tolerance is $0.01$. Please attach the code along with the final output.

**Q2)** Find the least natural number that divides $11^{n+1} + 12^{2n−1}$ by examining the values of this expression for small values of $n \in N$ , and prove the formula you conjectured.
