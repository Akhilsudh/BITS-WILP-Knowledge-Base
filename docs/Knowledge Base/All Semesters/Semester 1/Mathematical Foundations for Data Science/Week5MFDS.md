- S LI, LS(s) = V
   S is a basus No. of elements of S is dimension
- Several bases for V but dimenstion is the same
- Any set that contains 0 is LD
- Any non zero vector is LI

Construction of Basis
$S = {v_1}$
$v_1 \ne 0$
Span S =

Example
Consider a 3d space of x, y, z, and a span set as:
S = {(1, 0, 0)}
We can say that this does not span the entire spce, but it does cover the x axis
Now if we take:
S = {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)}

This set S is the Basis of
