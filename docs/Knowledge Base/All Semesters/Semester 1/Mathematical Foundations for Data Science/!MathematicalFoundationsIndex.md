# Mathematical Foundations for Data Science Index

This is the page for all Mathematical Foundations for Data Science Content.
**Note:** Since the live lectures for this subject was interactive and less theoretical, the notes takes as a result is quite minimal

#### Part 2 (Calculus / Induction / Counting)
Part 2 of this subject was problem heavy, so notes are captured in the [following pdf](https://github.com/Akhilsudh/BITS-WILP-Knowledge-Base/blob/master/docs/Knowledge%20Base/Assets/PDFs/MathNotes.pdf). Problems are not completely solved since this is only the notes captured during the live lecture itself.
