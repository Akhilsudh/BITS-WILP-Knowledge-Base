# DC Assignment
### Task
Write a program to implement the Ricart-Agrawala algorithm for implementing distributed mutual exclusion. Assume the communication channels to be FIFO in nature

### Instructions
- Put the source file(s) and a README file in one folder.
- Create a zipped folder containing the solution and submit the final zipped folder to the elearn portal.
- The README file should contain the relevant information required for compiling and executing code(s) for evaluation as well as any platform related dependency (like what operating system is required for execution). The README file should also contain the format of the input to be given to the program and any assumptions that you have made. It is mandatory to include the README file in your submission.

### My Submission
The code implementation along with the readme can be found [here](https://github.com/Akhilsudh/BITS-Assignment/tree/master/Semester%201/Distributed%20Computing)
