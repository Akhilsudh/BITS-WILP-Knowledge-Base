## Objective: To gain experience in architecting real-life applications in domains such as Retail, Transportation, Healthcare, Hospitality, etc. Example systems: Swiggy, Uber, an IoT system to monitor the health of industrial air conditioners.

## Activity:

- Identify top 3 Architecturally Significant Requirements (ASRs) and write them in the form of a Utility tree. Why are these architecturally significant?
- Describe in detail, the tactics you recommend for each ASR. For example, if caching is a tactic you recommend, please mention what you will cache, what tool you would use, how it will work, etc.
- Draw 2 software architecture diagrams – component & connection view and deployment view – to understand how the system works.
- Indicate important messages between components by labelling the connections in the C&C view. Also indicate the communication method used.
- Draw a sequence diagram for one major scenario (use case). Mention the scenario.
- State the architecture patterns used. Explain, wherein the architecture, these patterns have been used.
- What did you learn by doing this assignment? Mention 3 key learnings. One slide per person.
