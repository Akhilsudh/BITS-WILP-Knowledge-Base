**Q1.** Feedback scores of three professors in four different courses taught by them are given
below. Test the hypothesis that the feedback of professors is same for all the courses at 1%
level of significance.

| Professor | Course A | Course B | Course C | Course D | 
| --------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| X         | 4.5      | 4.2      | 3.3      | 3.6      |
| Y         | 3.8      | 4.1      | 2.7      | 4        |
| Z         | 4        | 3.4      | 3.4      | 3        |

**Q.2.** Consider the following data.

| PROCESS | SAMPLE SIZE | MEAN LIFE | STANDARD DEVIATION |
| ------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| A       | 20          | 20,400    | 100                |
| B       | 25          | 21,800    | 100                |

Test the hypothesis that average life of the two processes are significantly different at 5% level of
significance.

**Q.3.** Calculate the Correlation coefficient between the sample of ISM Quiz-1 marks and
Assignment-1 Marks as below and also interpret the result.
