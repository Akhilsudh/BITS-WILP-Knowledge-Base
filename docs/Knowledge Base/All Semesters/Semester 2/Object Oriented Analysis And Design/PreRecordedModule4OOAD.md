Includes invokes a new use case
Extends tries to relate an exception

In the above example we can see that `Rent items` extends `Sale Items`

## Derived Attributes
- During analysis step, analyst only records very obvious attributes
- During design phase there are more refined attributes that can be derived from another attribute

## Interaction Diagram
Interaction diagrams show relationship between objects, hence we see only objects interacting in the diagram (Anonymous or named objects) and no classes.

### Collaboration Diagram
![[Pasted image 20220307230459.png]]
- When few messages are involved then we can use a collaboration diagram
- Having many objects then collaboration diagram is a better way to go

### Sequence Diagram
![[Pasted image 20220307230712.png]]
- When the number of messages are a lot and there is a sequence of messages then it is better to use sequence diagrams.
- Only limitation is that a lot of objects cannot be placed horizontally.
