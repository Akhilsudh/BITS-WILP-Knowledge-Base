---

Instructions: 
1.	One can use any open source and/or proprietary software for the construction of UML state-chart-diagram. Hand drawn diagrams on a A4 sized paper are also allowed. 
2.	Use the concepts covered in the class for construction of an optimized diagram. 
3.	Copy cases direct/indirect (identified if any) will be awarded zero marks. 


Draw a state chart diagram for the following application description: 
Consider an online shopping website which sells books on different subjects. The user interface of their web application has three different modes. In the first mode, that is, search-browse-choose (sbc) mode the user can perform the following: 
- View a precompiled list of books like bestsellers, food, stories, etc. 
- Search for books by author name, or keywords in the title of the book. 
- User can retrieve another list while viewing one list. 
- The user can click on a book to get its description (ISBN, Author, Title, Year, Pages, Price etc.). 
- The user can add the item they are viewing in the shopping cart or move back to the list they were browsing. 
- The user can switch the sbc mode to decide-and-order (do) mode. 

In the do mode, the user is requested to verify his/her cart. In this mode the user can leave the cart as it is or they can remove the added items. Once the users confirm the cart items they switch from do mode to personal information entry (pie) mode. In the pie mode, the user provides his/her personal information for payment and delivery. The application is very flexible and allows the user to switch to previous mode from the current mode or exit.
