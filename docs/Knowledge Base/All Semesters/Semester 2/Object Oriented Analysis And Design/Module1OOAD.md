# Module 1
## Terminologies
#### Model

#### Modeling Language

A system is a collection of subsystems organized by models which are inturn depicted by views.

#### An Example
**System:** Aircraft
**Models:** Flight Simulator, Scale Model
**Views:** All blueprints, electrical wiring, fuel system

The ':' used to differentiate the name and the type of the object

## Object Oriented Modeling
### Why Models?
- To abstract reality and show essential details and filter out the rest.
- To deal with complexity.
- To allow us to focus on the big picture.
- To understand requirements, design cleanly, more maintainable systems.

### Why Objects?
- To more accurately reflect reality
- Reduce the semantic gap
- To localize changes

**Analysis Mode -** models related to an investigation of the domain and problem space (Example is a use case model)

**Design Mode -** models related to the solution (Example is a class diagram)

### Elements of modeling language
- UML is strictly just notations
- UML is not a methodology
- UML is not a process
- UML is not proprietary
- It is a collection of diagrams for system visualization of 
	- Software architecture
	- Behavior
	- Physical system

### Views in UML
- Use-case View: A view showing the functionality of the system as perceived by the external actors
- Logical View: A view showing the static structure and dynamic view
- Component View: A view showing the organization of the system
- Concurrency View
- Deployment View

### Intro to UML
#### Model ELements
- Class
- Object
- State
- Use Case

#### UML Diagrams
- Structural Diagrams
- Behavioral Diagrams
- **Use case diagram:** External interaction with actors

- **Class/Object Diagram:** Captures static structural aspects, objects and relationships
