## Programming paradigms

OO programming attempts to model interacting components to build a solution. This breaking down of final solution to interacting components makes it easy to maintain software.

## System Development Life Cycle SDLC
- Analyze: 
- Design
- Implement
- Test
- Deployment
- Maintenance

## SDLC Models
### Waterfall Model
![[Pasted image 20220209205504.png]]
All the stages are done one after the other from top to bottom. This means that all requirements are gathered first then it is all analyzed and then the design has started. Now it is difficult to add another requirement from the customer till the acceptance phase.

#### Advantages
1. Simple in approach

#### Disadvantages
1. Sequential in design no space for concurrency
2. It is not change friendly
3. Poor resource utilization, since any one stage is busy the others are on standstill.

### Unified Model
- For complex systems the linear approach of waterfall model does not suffice
- The UP is a process for object oriented
- UML is compulsory to use for Modeling
- Development is organized into a series of iterations
- The outcome of these iterations is a tested integrated and executable system
- An iteration represents a complete dev cycle with its own analysis, design, implementation and testing. 
- Iterations are short and rapid feedback and adaptation is done
- Iterations are timeboxed and the recommended iteration duration is about two to six weeks

## Unified Process
- The iterative lifecycle is based on refinement of a system through multiple iterations with feedback and adaptation
- The system grows incrementally over time, iteration by iteration
- The system may not be eligible or production deployment until many iterations

- The ouput of an iteration is not an experimental prototype but a production subset of the final system
- Each iteration tackles new requirements and incrementally extends the system
- An iteration may occasionally revisit existing software and improve it.

### Embracing change
- UP is change friendly
- Periodic testing and design based on rapid feedback leads to better product
- Gives developers a better understanding of the customers requirements

### Phases in UP
- Inception
- Elaboration
- Construction
- Transition
